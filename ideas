1.
For BERT models, we can try using pre-trained large models (e.g., BERT-large or RoBERTa) to get better performance. we can also try to fine-tune different layers of the BERT model to suit the needs of a specific task. For example, we can fine-tune only the top few layers of the BERT model (e.g., fine-tune only the last layer or the last two layers) and leave the rest of the layers fixed to avoid over-fitting.

When using the BERT model, we can also tune many hyperparameters such as batch size, learning rate, weight decay, etc. to get better performance. For example, using a larger batch size can speed up the training process, while using a smaller learning rate can help the model converge better.

Besides, we can also use other pre-processing techniques such as data augmentation, normalization, regularization, etc. to optimize the model performance. Other loss functions such as Focal Loss, Margin Loss, etc. can also be used to enhance the robustness and classification performance of the model.

In conclusion, when tuning the model, it is recommended to use the validation set to evaluate the performance of different hyperparameters and model structures to select the best model.

For multi-classification tasks, consider using splicing to add CLS features as an additional input channel to the output of the convolutional layer. This can make full use of the global information contained in the CLS features while preserving the local information in the convolutional layer, thus improving the classification performance while avoiding overfitting. Specifically, the output size of the convolutional layer can be [B, C, L], where B is the batch size, C is the number of channels, L is the sequence length, and the size of the CLS features is [B, C, 1]. Then, these two tensors are stitched together using the torch.cat() function to obtain a tensor of size [B, C, L+1], which is fed into the subsequent fully connected layer for classification.

In addition, the risk of overfitting can be further reduced by adding a Dropout layer, for example, adding a Dropout layer after the output of the convolutional layer to randomly discard some neurons with a certain probability. This can make the model more stable and improve the generalization performance.

3.
The first is binary classification, select the evidence, then multi-classification, classification
So we have to change the preprocess labels (there is a relationship, it does not matter), seg_id in the first half of the stage (select the evidence) can not be used

4. try using BertForSequenceClassification to do 2 classifications, BertForMultipleChoice to do multiple classifications

5. problem: the model will choose more evidence, probably the better the model, the more accurate (will not choose more), so before tuning, try different models (with or without segment, base or other special models, RoBERTa) to see if there is no impact on the results, and then choose how to optimize


6.
If the BERT model misclassifies irrelevant sentences as related, we can try the following methods to reduce this error:

Data augmentation: For irrelevant sentences in the training set, we can use data augmentation techniques (such as random substitution, random insertion, random deletion, etc.) to generate more negative samples to increase the model's ability to discriminate irrelevant sentences and improve the robustness of the model.

Introduce attention mechanisms: Attention mechanisms, such as self-attention and multi-head attention, can be tried to introduce semantic and associative information to better capture the relationship between two sentences.

Fine-tune different BERT models: one can try to fine-tune the model using other BERT variants or pre-trained models, such as RoBERTa, ALBERT, etc. These models may have learned more semantic and contextual information in the pre-training phase, which can improve the accuracy of the model.

Adding layers: The number of layers of the BERT model can be increased, thus increasing the complexity of the model and handling semantic and contextual information better.

Tuning the model: we can try to tune different hyperparameters in the model, such as learning rate, batch size, etc., in order to improve the performance of the model.

Integrating models: Several different models can be integrated together to make predictions by voting or weighted average to improve the accuracy and robustness of the model.

In summary, by tuning the model, data augmentation, and using attention mechanism, we can reduce the situation that BERT model misclassifies irrelevant sentences as related, and improve the performance and robustness of the model.
